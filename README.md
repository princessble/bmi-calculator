Description

Calculate your Body Mass Index easily and visually. 🎯

The BMI Calculator is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to enter their height and weight to instantly calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The app displays the BMI value, health category, and a visual color indicator bar to help users understand where they fall within standard BMI ranges.

This project was built as part of my Full Stack Web Development portfolio to demonstrate clean HTML structure, modern CSS styling, JavaScript logic, form validation, and basic accessibility practices.

About This Project

This project focuses on:

Clean UI and UX

Beginner-friendly JavaScript logic

Form validation

Accessibility improvements

W3C validation compliance

Visual feedback using a BMI indicator bar

The goal is to build practical, real-world mini applications that demonstrate strong foundational web development skills.

How It Works
Input Height & Weight 📏⚖️
<img src="assets/image/input.png" alt="BMI input fields">

Users enter:

Height in centimeters (cm)

Weight in kilograms (kg)

The app validates input to ensure realistic values before calculation.

BMI Calculation 🧠
<img src="assets/image/calc.png" alt="BMI calculation logic" width=300;>

The BMI formula used:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) × height (m))


JavaScript handles:

Unit conversion (cm → m)

Calculation

Rounding to 1 decimal place

Result & Indicator Bar 🎨
<img src="assets/image/result.png" alt="BMI result and indicator bar">

The app displays:

<li>BMI value</li>

<li>BMI category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)</li>

<li>A color indicator bar that visually represents where the BMI falls on the scale</li>
</ul>
